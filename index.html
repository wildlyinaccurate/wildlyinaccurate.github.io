has Amazon and eBay. In New Zealand we have TradeMe - an online auction &amp; classified advert website where Kiwis go to buy &amp; sell general items, cars, and property. If the numbers are to be believed, then pretty much every Kiwi has a TradeMe account. I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s an understatement to say that TradeMe is an itegral part of modern New Zealand culture.</p> <p>Back in 2016, <a href="https://investors.trademe.co.nz/media/75789/5-F16-Investor-presentation.pdf">TradeMe announced</a> that it was working on a new &#x201C;smartphone-optimised&#x201D; responsive website that will eventually also replace the desktop website. Then halfway through 2018, they announced that the new responsive website was being rolled out to real users.</p> <p>Being the ever-curious developer, I wanted to give the new TradeMe website a try. After a couple of weeks using the new website on my phone (a Nokia 7 Plus), I became frustrated with how much time I spent staring at a loading spinner, and how sluggish the UI interactions were. So I went back to the old website.</p> <div> </div> <p>This bothered me, because I know that the other TradeMe experiences are fast. Why should this new website be so slow? I wanted to dig deeper, so I&#x2019;ve taken the opportunity to conduct a detailed performance review.</p> <a href="/web-performance-review-trademe/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <h3> <a href="/becoming-a-team-lead-a-survival-guide/">Becoming a team lead: a survival guide</a> </h3> <small class="c-gl pt-2"> Jun 14, 2018 &#x2022; 26 minute read </small> <p></p><blockquote> <p><small>This post is a transposition of my Fluent talk <em>Becoming a team lead: a survival guide</em>.

Building shelter in the wilderness, foraging for food, avoiding being eaten by bears - that sort of thing. I&#x2019;m never sure when is the right time to read a survival guide, since being lost in the wilderness or being hunted by bears is not something you really plan for. If you read the survival guide too early, you forget most of it. If you read it too late, it&#x2019;s no use.</p> <p>Anyway, the reason this is a survival guide is because after spending my entire career as a software engineer, I was thrown into a team lead role without much warning. I had no idea what I was doing and had very little support. This is the survival guide I wish I had. It documents my experiences as an inexperienced team lead &#x2013;as an engineer transitioning to a team lead&#x2013; and my learnings &amp; mistakes along the way. Hopefully this can act as a survival guide for you, too.</p> <p>This is a fairly long guide, so I&#x2019;ve split it into sections.

Rendering every component in the browser does not provide an optimal experience &#x2014; especially for users on low-powered devices or low-speed connections. Instead, selectively bundling components for the browser reduces bundle sizes and minimizes CPU overhead without sacrificing React&#x2019;s event system and stateful components.</p> <p>Second is not a large or complex framework.

Today it employs around 20,000 people (actually around 35,000 when you include part-time and fixed-term contract employees) across a huge number of divisions. The <a href="http://careerssearch.bbc.co.uk/">BBC Careers website</a> typically has over 100 vacancies posted on any given day.

Usually I can get an idea of what it&#x2019;s like to work for a company by reading their job advertisements and their engineering blogs, but with the BBC I was almost completely clueless. In this post I hope to shed some light on what it&#x2019;s like to work as a developer or tester for BBC News.</p> <p>Just a small disclaimer first: from an engineering perspective, the BBC is not like most other companies &#x2014; it&#x2019;s more like dozens of smaller companies, each with their own engineering department, working towards a common goal. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news">News</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport">Sport</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes">Programmes</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">iPlayer</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio">Radio</a>&#x2026; As digital products, these are all built mostly independently of each other.

One of the things I talked about was how we used multivariate testing (MVT) at BBC News to prioritise performance optimisations. The gist of it was that our stakeholders had already bought into the idea that performance has a strong correlation to business metrics, and they wanted to dedicate some development time to improving performance. The catch was that they didn&#x2019;t want to spent <em>too much</em> time on it.</p> <p>Our predicament, then, was that we needed to know which optimisations had the biggest impact on performance without actually spending the time to make the optimisations. For example, we had a hunch that inlining the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/">critical rendering path</a> CSS would improve our start render time, but with over 1MB of CSS and a complicated application architecture, implementing this was much easier said than done.</p> <p>This is where the idea to A/B test performance came from: we could easily make the performance optimisations by hand on a single page, and then benchmark each of the optimisations to find out which had the biggest impact.</p> <a href="/using-ab-testing-to-prioritise-performance-optimisations/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <h3> <a href="/how-can-we-fix-open-source-culture/">How can we fix open source culture?</a> </h3> <small class="c-gl pt-2"> Mar 28, 2016 &#x2022; 1 minute read </small> <p></p><p>The recent kerfuffle around the <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm">NPM #unpublishgate</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/@boennemann/your-just-considered-harmful-679db7366b95">Greenkeeper bot impersonation</a> has got me thinking about the open source community and its culture.</p> <p>Sometimes the open source community feels like a wonderful, cooperative, welcoming place.

All objects in Git have a hash (like <code>99b69df491c0bcf5262a967313fad8be0098352e</code>) and are connected in a way that allows them to be modelled as a directed acyclic graph.</p> <h5>Reference</h5> <p>A reference in Git is a bit like a pointer, or a symlink. References are not objects themselves, and they always point to either an object or another reference. Branches, tags, and HEAD are examples of references.</p> <p>You can learn about all of this and much more in my <a href="/a-hackers-guide-to-git">Hacker&#x2019;s Guide to Git</a>.</p> <a href="/useful-git-commands/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <h3> <a href="/cabal-installing-readline-on-osx/">Cabal: Installing readline on OSX</a> </h3> <small class="c-gl pt-2"> Apr 26, 2015 &#x2022; 1 minute read </small> <p></p><p>I&#x2019;ve had trouble installing the <code>readline</code> package on a few separate OSX installations, so I figured it was worth writing the solution down.</p> <p>When running <code>cabal install</code> for a package which depends on <code>readline</code> (or simply when running <code>cabal install readline</code>), Cabal exits with errors along the lines of</p> <div><div><pre><code>Configuring readline-1.0.3.0...

I tend to type with mostly my forefinger and middle finger, only using my ring and pinky fingers occasionally to stretch out to the modifier keys. Despite this, I still manage to type at around 120WPM on a staggered QWERTY keyboard.</p> <p>Thinking back, I probably started teaching myself to type at a reasonable speed around age 10. I&#x2019;m now in my mid-twenties. My typing technique (or lack thereof) never really bothered me, but 15 years of typing with poor technique has started to take its toll. Recently I&#x2019;ve started experiencing hand fatigue, and I&#x2019;m beginning to see early signs of RSI. So I figure now is the perfect time to make some changes to the way I type.</p> <a href="/transitioning-to-a-new-keyboard-layout/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <div> <a class="btn p-3" href="/page2">&#x2190; Older Posts</a> </div> </section> <footer class="wrap mw-w mt-5 pt-4"> <ul class="ls-n f-r"> <li> <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate"> <span class="d-ib va-m w-4 h-4"> <svg viewbox="0 0 16 16"> <path fill="#828282" d="M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z"/> </svg> </span> <span>wildlyinaccurate</span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/joseph_wynn"> <span class="d-ib va-m w-4 h-4"> <svg viewbox="0 0 16 16"> <path fill="#828282" d="M15.969,3.058c-0.586,0.26-1.217,0.436-1.878,0.515c0.675-0.405,1.194-1.045,1.438-1.809
