If you want a quick way of getting Doctrine 2 working with CodeIgniter 2, you can download a pre-configured installation [from my GitHub repository](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/CodeIgniter-2-with-Doctrine-2). There are currently three branches available:

*   `master` - the latest stable versions of CodeIgniter and Doctrine.
*   `develop` - the latest development versions of CodeIgniter and Doctrine. Not recommended for production use.
*   `doctrine-2.1` - the latest stable version of CodeIgniter, and the latest stable 2.1.X version of Doctrine. This branch is provided as a way of keeping Doctrine 2.1 applications up to date without breaking backwards compatibility.

For more information, read my post on [integrating Doctrine 2 with CodeIgniter 2](/integrating-doctrine-2-with-codeigniter-2)
