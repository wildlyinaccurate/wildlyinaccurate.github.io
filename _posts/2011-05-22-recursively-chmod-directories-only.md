The `find` utility's -exec flag makes it very easy to recursively perform operations on specific files or directories.

```
find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
```

This command finds all directories (starting at 'dot' - the current directory) and sets their permissions to 755 (rwxr-xr-x).

```
find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

Similarly, this command finds all files and sets their permissions to 644 (rw-r--r--).
