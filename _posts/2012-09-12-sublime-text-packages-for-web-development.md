Coming from [PhpStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) (a full-featured IDE), I felt that Sublime Text was missing a few useful features. Luckily, one of the great things about Sublime is that it can be easily extended with [plugins](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/plugins.html) and packages. Perhaps the most useful package for Sublime is [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), which allows you to easily install and manage packages (it can even uninstall itself - über meta).

Below are some Sublime Text packages that I have found to be useful for web development.<!--more-->

*   [**All Autocomplete**](https://github.com/alienhard/SublimeAllAutocomplete) extends the Sublime Text autocompletion to find matches in all open files.
*   [**ApacheConf.tmLanguage**](https://github.com/colinta/ApacheConf.tmLanguage) provides ApacheConf syntax highlighting (for .htaccess, vhosts, etc).
*   [**DocBlockr**](https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-jsdocs) simplifies and automates writing DocBlock comments in many languages including PHP and JavaScript.
*   [**Sass**](https://github.com/nathos/sass-textmate-bundle) and [**LESS**](https://github.com/danro/LESS-sublime) both provide syntax highlighting for the Sass and LESS dynamic stylesheet languages. **[Compass](https://github.com/WhatWeDo/Sublime-Text-2-Compass-Build-System) **also provides a watch/build system for Sass.
*   [**SideBarEnhancements**](https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements) provides many useful enhancements to the default Sublime Text sidebar, including _Copy Path_ and _Open With..._
*   **[SublimeCodeIntel](http://github.com/Kronuz/SublimeCodeIntel)** is a full-featured code intelligence engine that provides smart autocomplete and jump-to-symbol functionality.
*   **[SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter)** automatically runs your code through a linter and highlights lines that it deems to contain (potential) errors. SublimeLinter has built-in linters for most popular languages.
