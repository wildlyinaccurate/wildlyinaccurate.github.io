## Hi there!

My name is Joseph. I'm a rock-climbing, tea-drinking developer from New Zealand. I'm hugely passionate about creating a fast, accessible, usable, and open web.

I'm currently working at [SpeedCurve](https://speedcurve.com/), doing my best to make sure we all create fast and usable websites. I've previously worked as a principal engineer at BBC News in London. You can read more about my work on [my résumé](https://resume.wildlyinaccurate.com/), or visit the [Projects](/projects/) page to see what I'm hacking on in my spare time.

The source and content for this website are all available [on GitHub](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/wildlyinaccurate.github.io).
