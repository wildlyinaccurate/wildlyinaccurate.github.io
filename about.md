## Hi there!

My name is Joseph. I'm a rock-climbing, tea-drinking developer working for the BBC in London. I'm hugely passionate about creating a fast, accessible, usable, and open web.

You can read more about my work on [my résumé](https://resume.wildlyinaccurate.com/), or visit the [Projects](/projects/) page to see what I'm hacking on in my spare time.

The source and content for this website are all available [on GitHub](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/wildlyinaccurate.github.io).
